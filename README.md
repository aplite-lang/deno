# Aplite's fork of deno

The repository currently contains a python script to fork
[Deno](https://github.com/denoland/deno). The reason for the fork is to make
`deno-cli` a library crate instead of just a binary crate so Aplite can depend
on the Typescript and the module loader of Deno.

The forks are located in different tags of this repository.
